## Deployments

PODs deploy single instance of our application.
Each container is encapuslated in the POD.  
Multiple such PODs are deployed using replication controllers or replicasets.  
Deployment is the kubernetes object that comes higher in the hierarchy. 
Deployment provides us with the capability to upgrade the underlying instances seemlessly using rolling updates, undo changes, pause and resume changes as required.  

To create a deployment we first create a deployment definition yaml file.
The contents of deployment definition file will be similar to the replicaset definition file, except the kind, which will be deployment.  

`kubectl create -f <deployment definition file>`  
To create the deployment.  

`kubectl get deployments`  
To view the created deployments. 
The deployment automatically creates replicaset. 

`kubectl describe deployment <deploymnet name>`  
To get more information about the particular deployment.

`kubectl get replicasets`  
To view the available replicasets.  
Here, we can see a new replicaset in the name of the deployment.  
replicaset ultimately create pods.  

`kubectl get pods`  
We can able to see the pods in the name of the deployment and the replicaset.  

`kubectl get all`  
To view all the objects created in the kuberntes cluster.
